In this project, we implemented Grove sensors and buttons on a beaglebone system
via a C program called lab4b.c
lab4b is an executable that takes keyboard commands to interact with the beaglebone.
check.sh is a test script to test the functionality of the beaglebone.
The Makefile includes a check that calls the check.sh along with the typical
make commands.
